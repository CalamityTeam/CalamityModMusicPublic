This mod adds the Calamity soundtrack and music boxes for each song on the soundtrack.

It is intended to be used alongside the Calamity Mod, but can be used alone.
You will need to cheat in the music boxes if you do not use the Calamity Mod.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS MOD DOES NOT ADD ANY CALAMITY GAME CONTENT.
You need to install the Calamity Mod for items, bosses, and so on.
